			<section class="intro">
				<p>In the past decade, the best AI systems (such as image generators, or a machine translation service), have
					been using a technique called deep learning.</p>
				<p>Deep learning is an approach to AI using neural networks. So how did neural networks get so popular?</p>

				<h2>A Simple Timeline of Neural Networks</h2>
				<p>Neural networks were first proposed in 1944 by Warren McCullough and Walter Pitts, two University of Chicago
					researchers.</p>
				<p>Neural networks were a major area of research in both neuroscience and computer science but have had a rough
					career: dying then resurging, then dying again, but finally resurging fueled by the increased processing power
					of graphics cards.</p>

			<section class="versatility">
				<h2>Versatility of Neural Networks</h2>
				<p>Neural networks are a very versatile tool. They are a means of learning how to perform a task by analyzing
					training examples.</p>
				<p>Let’s say you have a function. If you are given this function explicitly, then it is 100% guaranteed to
					replicate the correct output, given any input.</p>

			<section class="application">
				<h2>Application in Medicine</h2>
				<p>But what if you weren’t given the function at all, and instead, some data points and wanted to guess what the
					function was shaped like?</p>
				<p>For instance, there is no function that can tell you whether a tumor is malignant or benign. But using neural
					networks, we can give it some data and tell it to make some sense of it.</p>

				<p>If we train it well, then it can predict whether a given tumor is malignant or benign with decent precision.
